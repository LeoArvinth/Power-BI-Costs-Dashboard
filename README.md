🚀Just Launched: Multi-Cloud Cost Dashboard with Power BI!🚀 
I’m excited to share my latest project—Integration of Azure and AWS cost data into a unified Power BI dashboard! 
This project is designed to help monitor cloud costs at a granular level, ensuring there are no unnecessary deviations while empowering better decision-making for cloud resource usage. 
 
 
🔹 What’s Inside? 
📊 Azure & AWS cost management panes for scheduling detailed reports 
💾 Storage Accounts & S3 Buckets to store daily cost exports 
🔑 Azure Service Principal & AWS IAM User for secure authentication 
🧩 AWS Glue Crawler & Athena for converting CSV reports into analyzable tables 
🔗 Azure Cost Management Connector & AWS Athena ODBC Connector for Power BI 
📈 Power BI for interactive dashboard creation 
🎚️ Third-party slicers for timeline selection and better visualization 
 
 
🔹 Key Highlights 
✅ Simple, cost-free setup with minimal overhead 
📊 Consolidated costs from all services into clear charts & tables 
🛑 Immediate identification and elimination of unnecessary costs 
👏 Effective in management presentations—helped leadership make data-driven decisions 
 
 
🔹 Why It Matters 
Managing cloud costs is as important as scaling workloads. This solution reduces the workload of cloud representatives, makes cost tracking seamless, and even enables cross-cloud resource cost comparisons—helping organizations choose the most efficient option. 
 
 
🔹 How to Get Started 
Export Costs – Schedule daily cost exports into Azure Blob & AWS S3 
Azure Setup – Connect Power BI with Azure Cost Management Connector using Service Principal + Billing Account ID, ensuring all subscription & location attributes are pulled 
AWS Setup – 
Use AWS Glue Crawler to append S3 data into a new table 
Query the data with AWS Athena 
Configure Athena ODBC Connector on your device with IAM Access Keys 
Ensure all account & region-level details flow into Power BI 
Power BI – 
Perform transformations (merge tables, clean data, correct formats)
Build an interactive, visually appealing cost dashboard that merges Azure + AWS insights seamlessly 
 

🔹 Just in Time with Git 
💻 Navigate to my GitHub repo below 👇
 📂 Use the .pbit file to instantly build an exact replica of my Power BI dashboard
 🧾 Refer to the raw data sheet to understand the input values required
 ⚙️ Explore the .pbix file to see how data transformation and cleaning were performed to craft a reliable, production-ready dashboard
 

🔹 Tech Stack 
Power BI | Azure Cost Management | AWS Glue | AWS Athena | ODBC Connector | Azure Blob | AWS S3 
 

🙏 Shoutouts 
Been struggling in many areas while cleaning the raw extracted data from Azure & AWS—a huge thanks to Vigneshwar Jeyakumar for helping me transform raw cost data into reliable insights. His valuable inputs added precision to preparing this visually striking dashboard.
